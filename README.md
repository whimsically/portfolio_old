# Developer Portfolio

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a developer portfolio page with responsive layout. I used flexbox combined with media queries to change from a horizontal navigation bar for smaller screens (mobile first!) and a vertical one with additional links on larger screens. I also used this to experiment with other CSS properties like gradients and text shadows.
